# Survival on patients having cardiovascular heart disease
Machine learning prediction of survival on patients having cardiovascular heart disease

### Requirements
R programming language and platform (version 3.6.2 or greater)

### Instructions
Download the current GitHub repository.
To perform the predictions on the primary cohort, type on terminal shell:

`/usr/bin/Rscript random_forest_feature_selection.r`

All the other methods available in the `/bin/` folder can be called in the same way.
